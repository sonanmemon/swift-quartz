abstract: "I critically examine the burgeoning literature on inequality in economics. I report major empirical stylized facts on wealth/income inequality in the world and specifically in Pakistan. I also discuss arguments presented by many economists and some philosophers regarding the undesirability of wealth and income inequality and policies recommended to reduce inequality. I present several arguments in defense of economic inequality by establishing its role in creating incentives, economic growth, and urbanization. I also argue that many of the policies proposed for ejecting inequality from the society impede on individual and social freedoms. Moreover, there are theoretical and philosophical conundrums regarding how to share the pie of wealth and income which stifle attempts to redistribute. Lastly, I ask the why question by interrogating the relevance of inequality, making the case that absolute poverty, pain and suffering are the relevant curses which have to be excommunicated from an ideal society rather than the distribution of wealth and income."
